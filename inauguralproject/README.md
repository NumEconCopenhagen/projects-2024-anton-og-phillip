# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

This project models an exchange economy with two consumers and two goods. We use python to simulate and solve the model given some utility functions and parameters such as endowments of each good. The result is different allocations of goods and utility for each consumer depending on the different optimization constraints we model. We model these allocations in an edgeworth box and part 6b discusses how the setup of the maximization problem affects the resulting allocation depending on the market construction.
