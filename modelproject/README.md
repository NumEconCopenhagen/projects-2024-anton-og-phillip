# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Solving the OLG model with an iterative, binary search algorithm**. The project explores how the optimal savings rate in a 2 period OLG setting can be computed via an iterative binary search algorithm. We also extend the model by relaxing the assumption of log utility, allowing for a more general solution based on the CRRA utility function.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
